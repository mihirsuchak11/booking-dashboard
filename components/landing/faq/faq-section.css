/**
 * EXCEPTION: Custom CSS for animations
 * 
 * This file contains @keyframes animations for Radix UI Accordion component
 * that integrate with CSS variables (--radix-accordion-content-height) and
 * cannot be easily replicated with Tailwind CSS.
 * 
 * Rule Exception: .cursor/rules/nextjs-shadcn.mdc - "No custom CSS files"
 * Justification: Radix UI accordion animations require integration with
 * component-specific CSS variables and include prefers-reduced-motion support
 * for accessibility.
