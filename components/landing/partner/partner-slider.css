/**
 * EXCEPTION: Custom CSS for animations
 * 
 * This file contains @keyframes animations for infinite scrolling that cannot
 * be easily replicated with Tailwind CSS. These animations are performance-optimized
 * and include prefers-reduced-motion support for accessibility.
 * 
 * Rule Exception: .cursor/rules/nextjs-shadcn.mdc - "No custom CSS files"
 * Justification: Complex infinite scroll animations require custom CSS with
 * will-change optimization and accessibility considerations.
