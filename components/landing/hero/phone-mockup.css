/**
 * EXCEPTION: Custom CSS for animations
 * 
 * This file contains @keyframes animations for phone mockup appearance and
 * bubble slide-up effects that cannot be easily replicated with Tailwind CSS.
 * These animations are performance-optimized with proper timing functions.
 * 
 * Rule Exception: .cursor/rules/nextjs-shadcn.mdc - "No custom CSS files"
 * Justification: Complex multi-stage animations (phoneAppear, bubbleSlideUp)
 * require custom CSS with specific timing and transform combinations.
