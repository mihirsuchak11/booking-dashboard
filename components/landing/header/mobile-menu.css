/**
 * EXCEPTION: Custom CSS for animations
 * 
 * This file contains @keyframes animations for mobile menu fade-in effects
 * that cannot be easily replicated with Tailwind CSS. These animations are
 * performance-optimized with proper timing functions.
 * 
 * Rule Exception: .cursor/rules/nextjs-shadcn.mdc - "No custom CSS files"
 * Justification: Complex fade-in animations with transform combinations
 * require custom CSS for optimal performance and visual quality.
